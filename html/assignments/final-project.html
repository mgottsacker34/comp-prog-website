            <p>

                The final project for this class will take place over several weeks, and via several stages. The entire process will emulate the Agile software development methodology. Each stage will have an accompanying review practice, through which your peers and I will provide feedback that should be addressed in the next development iteration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The foundational project instructions are straightforward: you will build a piece of software that accomplishes some sort of nontrivial goal. On an individual project basis, we (the instructor and each student) will agree on how that should appear. A standard requirement will certainly be clean, well-structured, well-documented Java code.
            </p>

              Start thinking critically about the software you might want to construct. Think about the software you use everyday. Think about the programming concepts you have learned how to use this semester. How can you apply those in a novel way?

                Write a text adventure game in Java. 
                <br><br>
                Your game <b>must</b> include all of the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A title.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A plot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        5 stages, each with its own task or activity for the user. Each stage must have at least one user interaction (gathering input from user). The code for each stage must be in its own method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A character representing the user. The character must have:
                        <ol>
                            <li>a name (can be user-entered)</li>
                            <li>some kind of special ability that affects gameplay</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>
                        An instance of ASCII art.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An element of luck and <b>three</b> elements of randomness that affect gameplay. This could be a randomly-generated number that affects the user's success overall, or for a specific task. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A mathematical computation using a formula (something more complex than simple math).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some kind of matrix generated with a loop and according to some pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some other looping element.

                The final project for this class will take place over several weeks, and via several stages. The entire process will emulate the Agile software development methodology. Each stage will have an accompanying review practice, through which your peers and I will provide feedback that should be addressed in the next development iteraction.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The foundational project instructions are straightforward: you will build a piece of software that accomplishes some sort of nontrivial goal. On an individual project basis, we will agree on how that should appear.</b>

            <p>
                Write a text adventure game in Java. This project option is more open-ended, but has some stipulations. 
                <br><br>
                Your game <b>must</b> include all of the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A title.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A plot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        5 stages, each with its own task or activity for the user. Each stage must have at least one user interaction (gathering input from user). The code for each stage must be in its own method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A character representing the user. The character must have:
                        <ol>
                            <li>a name (can be user-entered)</li>
                            <li>some kind of special ability that affects gameplay</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An instance of ASCII art.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An element of luck and <b>three</b> elements of randomness that affect gameplay. This could be a randomly-generated number that affects the user's success overall, or for a specific task. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A mathematical computation using a formula (something more complex than simple math).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some kind of matrix generated with a loop and according to some pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some other looping element.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                In an email with subject line <b>Computer Programming Final Project</b>, send me your project <code>.java</code> file. If you choose Option A, name your file <code>FinalProjectA.java</code>. Put each part of the Option A code in its own method. For Option B, name your file the same as the name of your game (for example: <code>Viro.java</code>).

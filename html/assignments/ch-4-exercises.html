                4.101: Multiple addition quizzes
            </h3>
            <p>
                Write a program that gives the user up to four addition quizzes. Each quiz should generate two integers between 10 and 20, and prompt the user to answer the sum of them. After each of the first three quizzes, ask the user whether they want to continue. After the final quiz (or after they stop answering questions), print the user's score as a percentage with two decimal places.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sample runs:
                <pre><code class="hljs">
What is 13 + 15? <span class="console-input">28</span>
That is correct. Would you like another quiz? (y/n): <span class="console-input">y</span>
What is 11 + 20? <span class="console-input">30</span>
That is incorrect. Would you like another quiz? (y/n): <span class="console-input">y</span>
What is 13 + 16? <span class="console-input">29</span> 
That is correct. Would you like to continue? (y/n): <span class="console-input">n</span>
Your score is 66.67%
                </code></pre>

                <pre><code class="hljs">
What is 14 + 11? <span class="console-input">25</span>
That is correct. Would you like another quiz? (y/n): <span class="console-input">y</span>
What is 11 + 11? <span class="console-input">22</span>
That is correct. Would you like another quiz? (y/n): <span class="console-input">y</span>
What is 13 + 14? <span class="console-input">27</span> 
That is correct. Would you like to continue? (y/n): <span class="console-input">y</span>
What is 20 + 10? <span class="console-input">30</span>
That is correct.
Your score is 100.00%
                </code></pre>

            <h3>
                4.102: What are the odds?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Write a program that plays the "odds game." Prompt the user to enter a task for which they want to play the game. Then, prompt the user to enter the highest bounds of the odds game. Generate a random number between 1 and that upper bound. Prompt the user to enter the number they are guessing, and tell them whether they guessed the number.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sample runs:
                <pre><code class="hljs">
What are the odds...

What task are you putting on the line? <span class="console-input">eat a tablespoon of cinnamon</span>
What are the odds you will eat a tablespoon of cinnamon? 1 in <span class="console-input">20</span>
Enter your number between 1 and 20: <span class="console-input">6</span>
The computer generated 6 as well. You must eat a tablespoon of cinnamon!
                </code></pre>

                <pre><code class="hljs">
What are the odds...

What task are you putting on the line? <span class="console-input">drink a gallon of milk</span>
What are the odds you will drink a gallon of milk? 1 in <span class="console-input">50</span>
Enter your number between 1 and 20: <span class="console-input">26</span>
The computer generated 15. You do not have to drink a gallon of milk.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Write a program that prompts the user to enter an 6-character plaintext password that contains at least one of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>uppercase letter <b>(although the first character cannot be uppercase)</b></li>
                    <li>lowercase letter</li>
                    <li>number</li>
                    <li>special symbol (a secondary key from the top row of the keyboard that you get from pressing <code>Shift + [number]</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                Notify the user about whether the password meets the requirements, and improvements they can make.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sample runs:
                <pre><code class="hljs">
This program verifies that your 6-character plaintext password contains at least one of each of the following:
    - uppercase letter (although the first character cannot be uppercase)
    - lowercase letter
    - number 
    - special symbol (such as ! or @ or #)
Enter your password: <span class="console-input">sAfe!1</span>
That password meets our strength requirements.

                Write a program that prompts the user to enter an 6-character plaintext password. Transform the password to make it stronger. Specifically:
                <ul>

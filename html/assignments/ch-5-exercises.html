                Write a program that prints out the winningest soccer team given a series of team names and their number of wins in the season. Prompt the user to enter the number of teams that are in the league. Then, collect each team's name and their number of wins in the season. Then, display the name of the team with the most wins.

                Rewrite Exercise 4.102, taking advantage of loops. When the program is first run, prompt the user to enter the number of quizzes that they would like to take. Each quiz should generate two integers between 10 and 20, and prompt the user to answer the sum of them. After the last quiz, output the user's score to two decimal places.

                Rewrite Exercise 4.103, taking advantage of looping. The user should enter a password with <b>any number of characters</b>. The password must contain at least one of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>uppercase letter</li>
                    <li>lowercase letter</li>
                    <li>number</li>
                    <li>special symbol (a secondary key from the top row of the keyboard that you get from pressing <code>Shift + [number]</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                Notify the user about whether the password meets the requirements, and improvements they can make.

                Rewrite Exercise 4.104, taking advantage of looping. Prompt the user to enter a password of <b>any length</b>. Transform the password to make it stronger. Specifically:
                <ul>
                    <li>Capitalize the second-last character if it is a letter.</li>

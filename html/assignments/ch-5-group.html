                Introduction to cryptography: the Vigenère Cipher
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher">Wikipedia</a>: </b>

                <br>
                
                "The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar ciphers</a>, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.

                First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later. This earned it the description <em>le chiffre indéchiffrable</em> (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.
                
                In the 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596), and so acquired its present name."

                <br><br>

                Understanding this encryption pattern is beneficial to understanding fundamental cryptography. While it is not unbreakable, the Vigenère cipher holds up relatively well to attacks, assuming the key is kept secret between the communicating parties. You will programmatically encrypt and decrypt messages according to this cipher and perform some basic cryptanalysis.

                <br><br>

                Encrypting a message requires three parts: a message, a key, and an algorithm. The message, in this case, is any string of text. The key can be any other string of text with a length less than or equal to the length of the message. To encrypt, the algorithm uses the key to scramble each letter of the message. To decrypt, the algorithm uses the key to unscramble each letter of the encrypted text.

                <br><br>

                First, the cipher extends the key by repeating each letter of the key until it matches the length of the message. So, if the message is 
                <pre><code class="hljs">SECRETMESSAGE</code></pre>
                and the key is 
                <pre><code class="hljs">KEY</code></pre>
                then, the key becomes
                <pre><code class="hljs">KEYKEYKEYKEYK</code></pre>

                The key works as a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar ciphers</a> on the original message. A Caesar cipher shifts a character by another character's offset from the beginning of the character set. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E352JJ8xv48">This video demonstrates shifting a message according to a Vigenère key</a>. Note that in the video, they only deal with capital letters, indexed 0 to 25. The character set you will use in this project is all of the printable characters in the ASCII code. As you can see from <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">this table</a>, these character have decimal values between <b>32 and 126</b> (inclusive). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your task is to implement encryption and decryption according to this algorithm for any string of message text and for any key. Spaces may show up in either string. 
                <br><br>
                This project is designed for groups of two people. There will be one group of three.

            <h4>
                Part 1: Encrypt a message using the Vigenère cipher
            </h4>
            <p>
                Write a Java program called <code>Encryptor.java</code> that encrypts a message using the Vigenère cipher. Prompt the user to enter their secret message. Then, prompt them to enter their secret key. Encrypt their message using the key and the algorithm described above. Finally, output the encrypted message to the user.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>
                Part 2: Decrypt a Vigenère cipher-encoded message
            </h4>
            <p>
                Write a Java program called <code>Decryptor.java</code> that decrypts a Vigenère cipher-encoded message. Prompt the user to enter a string of encrypted text. Then, prompt them to enter the secret key. Decrypt the scrambled string using the key and with a reversal of the algorithm described above. Finally, output the original message to the user.

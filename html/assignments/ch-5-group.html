                Introduction to cryptography: the Vigenère Cipher
            </h3>
            <p>
                From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher">Wikipedia</a>: 

                <br><br>
                
                "The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar ciphers</a>, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.

                First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later. This earned it the description <em>le chiffre indéchiffrable</em> (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.
                
                In the 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596), and so acquired its present name."

                <br><br>

                Understanding this encryption pattern is beneficial to understanding fundamental cryptography. While it is not unbreakable, the Vigenère cipher holds up relatively well to attacks, assuming the key is kept secret between the communicating parties. You will programmatically encrypt and decrypt messages according to this cipher and perform some basic cryptanalysis.

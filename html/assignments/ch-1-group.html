                This project is designed for groups of two people. There will be one group of three.

                Even in his younger years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a> was inventive and enterprising. In college, he reverse-engineered the ink cartridge of an inkjet printer and optimized it for printing large posters.

                Problem
            </h5>
            <p>
                Larry offers his services to the University of Michigan's Student Activities Center. Over the course of 5 weeks, his printing company follows a consistent trend:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On every day of the week, 1 poster is printed every 7 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On Mondays, an extra poster is printed every 45 minutes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Larry charges $0.60 for each poster printed. It costs him $0.10 to print each one.
            </p>
            <!-- <hr> -->
            <h5>
                Task
            </h5>
            <p>
                Write a Java program to calculate and display Larry's <b>accumulated profit</b> at the end of each week. Assume he starts with $0.00. Write a document describing the problem, your programmatic approach, and your solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submit your work in the <code>Project_1</code> folder. Your Java program should be called <code>Project_1.java</code>. The discussion document should be called <code>README.txt</code>.
